    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a diagnostic payload format to be returned in
      TCP RST segments. Such payloads are used to share with the endpoints the
      reasons for which a TCP connection has been reset. This is meant to ease
      diagnostic and troubleshooting.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>A TCP connection <xref target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis"></xref> can
      be reset by a peer for various reasons, e.g., received data does not
      correspond to an active connection. Also, a TCP connection can be reset
      by an on-path service function (e.g., CGN <xref
      target="RFC6888"></xref>, NAT64 <xref target="RFC6146"></xref>,
      firewall) for several reasons. Typically, a NAT function can generate an
      RST segment to notify the peers upon the expiry of the lifetime of the
      corresponding mapping entry or because an RST segment was received from
      a peer (Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC7857"></xref>). A TCP connection
      can also be closed by a user or an application at any time. However, the
      peer that receives an RST segment does not have any hint about the
      reason that led to terminating the connection. Likewise, the application
      that relies upon such a TCP connection may not easily identify the
      reason for a connection closure. Troubleshooting such events at the
      remote side of the connection that receives the RST segment may not be
      trivial.</t>

      <t>This document fills this void by specifying a format of the
      diagnostic payload that is returned in an RST segment. Returning such
      data is consistent with the provision in Section 3.5.3 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis"></xref> for RST segments.</t>

      <t>This document does not change the conditions under which an RST
      segment is generated (Section 3.5.2 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis"></xref>).</t>

      <t>The generic procedure for processing an RST segment is specified in
      Section 3.5.3 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis"></xref>. Only
      the deviations from that procedure to insert and validate an enclosed
      diagnostic payload is provided in <xref target="new"></xref>. <xref
      target="examples"></xref> provides a set of examples to illustrate the
      use of TCP RST diagnostic payloads.</t>

      <t>This document specifies the format and the overall approach to ease
      maintaining the list of codes while allowing for adding new codes as
      needed in the future and accommodating any existing vendor-specific
      codes. An initial version of error codes is available in <xref
      target="initial"></xref>. However, the authoritative source to retrieve
      the full list of error codes is the IANA-maintained registry <xref
      target="reg"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="notation" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>This document makes use of the terms defined in Section 4 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="new" title="RST Diagnostic Payload">
      <t>The RST diagnostic payload MUST be encoded using Concise Binary
      Object Representation (CBOR) Sequence <xref target="RFC8742"></xref>.
      The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) <xref
      target="RFC8610"></xref> for the diagnostic payload is as
      follows:<figure anchor="sddl"
          title="Structure of the RST Diagnostic Payload">
          <artwork><![CDATA[   ; This defines an array, the elements of which are to be used
   ; in a CBOR Sequence:
   diagnostic-payload = [magic-word, reason]
   ; Magic word to identify a payload that follows this specification
   magic-word = 12345
   ; Reset reason details:
   reason= {
     ? reason-code: uint,
     ? pen:uint, 
     ? reason-description: tstr,
   }
]]></artwork>
        </figure></t>

      <t>The RST diagnostic payload comprises a magic word that is used to
      unambiguously identify an RST payload that follows this specification.
      It MUST be set to the RFC number to be assigned to this document. <list
          style="empty">
          <t>Note to the RFC Editor: Please replace "12345" with the RFC
          number assigned to this document.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>All parameters in the reason component of an RST diagnostic payload
      are mapped to their CBOR key values as specified in <xref
      target="map"></xref>. The description of these parameters is as follows:
      <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="reason-code:">This parameter takes a value from an
          available registry such as the "TCP Failure Causes" registry (<xref
          target="reg"></xref>).</t>

          <t hangText="pen:">Includes a Private Enterprise Number <xref
          target="Private-Enterprise-Numbers"></xref>. This parameter is
          included when the reason code is not taken from the IANA-maintained
          registry (<xref target="reg"></xref>), but from a vendor-specific
          registry.</t>

          <t hangText="reason-description:">It includes a brief description of
          the reset reason. This parameter SHOULD NOT be included if a reason
          code is supplied. This parameter is useful only for reset reasons
          that are not yet registered or for application-specific reasons.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>At least one of "reason-code" and "reason-description" parameters
      MUST be included in an RST diagnostic payload. It is RECOMMENDED to omit
      "pen" if a reason code from the IANA-maintained registry (<xref
      target="reg"></xref>) fits the reset case.</t>

      <t>Malformed RST diagnostic payload messages that include the magic
      number MUST be silently ignored by the receiver.</t>

      <t>A peer that receives a valid diagnostic payload may pass the reset
      reason information to the local application in addition to the
      information (MUST-12) described in Section 3.6 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis"></xref>. That information may also be
      logged locally, unless a local policy specifies otherwise. How the
      information is passed to an application and how it is stored locally is
      implementation specific. </t>

    <section anchor="examples" title="Some Examples">
      <t>To ease readability, the CBOR diagnostic notation (Section 8 of <xref

      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis"></xref> discusses TCP-related

      <t>In addition to these considerations, it is RECOMMENDED to control the
