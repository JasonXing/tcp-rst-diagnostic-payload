      <t>This document specifies a diagnostic payload format to be returned in
      TCP RST segments. Such payloads are used to share with the endpoints the
      reasons for which a TCP connection has been reset. This is meant to ease
      diagnostic and troubleshooting.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>A TCP connection <xref target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis"></xref> can
      be reset by a peer for various reasons, e.g., received data does not
      correspond to an active connection. Also, a TCP connection can be reset
      by an on-path service function (e.g., CGN <xref
      target="RFC6888"></xref>, NAT64 <xref target="RFC6146"></xref>,
      firewall) for several reasons. Typically, a NAT function can generate an
      RST segment to notify the peers upon the expiry of the lifetime of the
      corresponding mapping entry or because an RST segment was received from
      a peer (Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC7857"></xref>). A TCP connection
      can also be closed by a user or an application at any time. However, the
      peer that receives an RST segment does not have any hint about the
      reason that led to terminating the connection. Likewise, the application
      that relies upon such a TCP connection may not easily identify the
      reason for a connection closure. Troubleshooting such events at the
      remote side of the connection that receives the RST segment may not be
      trivial.</t>

      <t>This document fills this void by specifying a format of the
      diagnostic payload that is returned in an RST segment. Returning such
      data is consistent with the provision in Section 3.5.3 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis"></xref> for RST segments.</t>

      <t>This document does not change the conditions under which an RST
      segment is generated (Section 3.5.2 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis"></xref>).</t>

      <t>The generic procedure for processing an RST segment is specified in
      Section 3.5.3 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis"></xref>. Only
      the deviations from that procedure to insert and validate an enclosed
      diagnostic payload is provided in <xref target="new"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The first version of the specification is meant to discuss the format
      and the overall approach to ease maintaining the list of codes while
      allowing for adding new codes as needed in the future and accommodating
      any existing vendor-specific codes. An initial version of error codes is
      available at <xref target="initial"></xref>. However, the authoritative
      source to retrieve the full list of error codes is the IANA-maintained
      registry <xref target="reg"></xref>.</t>

    <section anchor="notation" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>This document makes use of the terms defined in Section 4 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis"></xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="new" title="RST Diagnostic Payload">
      <t>In order to unambiguously identify an RST diagnostic payload that is
      compliant with the present specification, the payload MUST use the
      I-JSON message format <xref target="RFC7493"></xref>. The following
      parameters are defined: <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="rc:">Stands for "Reason Code". This parameter takes a
          value from an available registry such as the "TCP Failure Causes"
          registry (<xref target="reg"></xref>).</t>

          <t hangText="pen:">Includes a Private Enterprise Number <xref
          target="Private-Enterprise-Numbers"></xref>. This attribute is
          included when the reason code is not taken from the IANA-maintained
          registry (<xref target="reg"></xref>), but from a vendor-specific
          registry.</t>

          <t hangText="rd:">Stands for "Reason Description". It includes a
          brief description of the reset reason. This parameter SHOULD NOT be
          included if a reason code is supplied. This parameter is useful only
          for codes that are not yet registered or for application-specific
          codes.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>At least "rc" and "rd" parameters MUST be included in an RST
      diagnostic payload. It is RECOMMENDED to omit "pen" if a reason code
      from the IANA-maintained registry (<xref target="reg"></xref>) fits the
      reset case.</t>

      <t>Malformed RST diagnostic payload messages MUST be silently ignored by
      the receiver.</t>

      <t>A peer that receives a valid diagnostic payload may pass that
      information to the local application in addition to the information
      (MUST-12) described in Section 3.6 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis"></xref>. That information may also be
      logged locally, unless a local policy specifies otherwise.</t>

      <t><xref target="ex1"></xref> depicts an example of an RST diagnostic
      payload that is generated to inform the peer that the connection is
      reset because an ACK was received while the connection is still in the
      LISTEN state.</t>

      <t>An RST diagnostic payload may also be reset by an on-path service
      function. For example, the following diagnostic payload is returned by a
      NAT uppon expiry of the mapping entry to which the TCP connection is
      bound (<xref target="ex3"></xref>).</t>

      <section anchor="reg" title="New Registry for TCP Failure Causes">
        <t>This document requests IANA to create a new subregistry entitled
        "TCP Failure Causes" under the "Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
        Parameters" registry <xref target="IANA-TCP"></xref>.</t>

        <t>Values are taken from RANGE.</t>

        <t>The assignment policy for this registry is "Expert Review" (Section
        4.5 of <xref target="RFC8126"></xref>).</t>

        <t>The designated experts may approve registration once they checked
        that the new requested code is not covered by an existing code and if
        the provided reasoning to register the new code is acceptable. A
        registration request may supply a pointer to a specification where
        that code is defined. However, a registration may be accepted even if
        no permanent and readily available public specification is
        available.</t>

        <t>The registry is initially populated with the following values:</t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis"></xref> discusses TCP-related
      security considerations. RST-specific attacks and their mitigations are
      discussed in Section 3.10.7.3 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis"></xref>.</t>

      <t>In addition to these considerations, it is RECOMMENDED to control the
      size of acceptable diagnostic payload and keep it as brief as possible.
      Also, it is RECOMMENDED to avoid leaking privacy-related information as
      part of the diagnostic payload (e.g., including a description such as
      "user X resets explicitly the connection" is not recommended).</t>
