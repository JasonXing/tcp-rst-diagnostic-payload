1.  Introduction

   A TCP connection [I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis] can be reset by a peer for
   various reasons, e.g., received data does not correspond to an active
   connection.  Also, a TCP connection can be reset by an on-path
   service function (e.g., CGN [RFC6888], NAT64 [RFC6146], firewall) for
   several reasons.  Typically, a NAT function can generate an RST
   segment to notify the peers upon the expiry of the lifetime of the
   corresponding mapping entry or because an RST segment was received
   from a peer (Section 2.2 of [RFC7857]).  A TCP connection can also be
   closed by a user or an application at any time.  However, the peer
   that receives an RST segment does not have any hint about the reason
   that led to terminating the connection.  Likewise, the application
   that relies upon such a TCP connection may not easily identify the
   reason for a connection closure.  Troubleshooting such events at the
   remote side of the connection that receives the RST segment may not
   be trivial.

   This document fills this void by specifying a format of the
   diagnostic payload that is returned in an RST segment.  Returning
   such data is consistent with the provision in Section 3.5.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis] for RST segments.

   This document does not change the conditions under which an RST
   segment is generated (Section 3.5.2 of [I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis]).

   The generic procedure for processing an RST segment is specified in
   Section 3.5.3 of [I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis].  Only the deviations from
   that procedure to insert and validate an enclosed diagnostic payload
   is provided in Section 3.

Internet-Draft           RST Diagnostic Payload               March 2022


   The first version of the specification is meant to discuss the format
   and the overall approach to ease maintaining the list of codes while
   allowing for adding new codes as needed in the future and
   accommodating any existing vendor-specific codes.  An initial version
   of error codes is available at Table 1.  However, the authoritative
   source to retrieve the full list of error codes is the IANA-
   maintained registry Section 4.2.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document makes use of the terms defined in Section 4 of
   [I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis].

   To ease readability, parameter names and their JSON types are used in
   the examples rather than their Concise Binary Object Representation
   (CBOR) [RFC8949] key values and CBOR types in Section 4.1.

3.  RST Diagnostic Payload

   The RST diagnostic payload MUST be encoded using CBOR [RFC8949].  All
   parameters in the RST diagnostic payload are mapped to CBOR types as
   specified in Section 4.1.  The Concise Data Definition Language
   (CDDL) [RFC8610] for the diagnostic payload is as follows:

                              diagnostic-payload = {
                                magic-word: tstr,
                                ? reason-code: uint,
                                ? pen:uint,
                                ? reason-description: tstr,
                              }

             Figure 1: Structure of the RST Diagnostic Payload

      NOTE: See if we need to add a magic word to unambiguously identify
      an RST payload that follows this spec.

   The description of these parameters is as follows:

   reason-code:  This parameter takes a value from an available registry
      such as the "TCP Failure Causes" registry (Section 4.2).

   pen:  Includes a Private Enterprise Number



Boucadair                Expires 2 October 2022                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft           RST Diagnostic Payload               March 2022


      [Private-Enterprise-Numbers].  This parameter is included when the
      reason code is not taken from the IANA-maintained registry
      (Section 4.2), but from a vendor-specific registry.

   reason-description:  It includes a brief description of the reset
      reason.  This parameter SHOULD NOT be included if a reason code is
      supplied.  This parameter is useful only for codes that are not
      yet registered or for application-specific codes.

   At least "reason-code" and "reason-description" parameters MUST be
   included in an RST diagnostic payload.  It is RECOMMENDED to omit
   "pen" if a reason code from the IANA-maintained registry
   (Section 4.2) fits the reset case.

   Malformed RST diagnostic payload messages MUST be silently ignored by
   the receiver.

   A peer that receives a valid diagnostic payload may pass that
   information to the local application in addition to the information
   (MUST-12) described in Section 3.6 of [I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis].
   That information may also be logged locally, unless a local policy
   specifies otherwise.

   Figure 2 depicts a JSON-encoded example of RST diagnostic payload
   that is generated to inform the peer that the connection is reset
   because an ACK was received while the connection is still in the
   LISTEN state.

   {
    "reason-code": 2
   }

        Figure 2: An RST Diagnostic Payload with Reason Code (JSON)

   The corresponding CBOR encoding format for the diagnostic payload is
   depicted in Figure 3.

   A1    # map(1)
      01 # unsigned(1)
      02 # unsigned(2)

    Figure 3: An RST Diagnostic Payload with Reason Code (CBOR Encoding)


   Figure 4 shows a JSON-encoded example of RST diagnostic payload that
   includes a free description to report a case that is not covered yet
   by the IANA-maintained registry (Section 4.2).

   {
    "reason-description": "brief human-readable description"
   }

     Figure 4: An RST Diagnostic Payload with Reason Description (JSON)

   An RST diagnostic payload may also be reset by an on-path service
   function.  For example, the following diagnostic payload is returned
   by a NAT upon expiry of the mapping entry to which the TCP connection
   is bound (Figure 5).

   {
    "reason-code": 8
   }

      Figure 5: An RST Diagnostic Payload to Report Connection Timeout
                                   (JSON)

   Figure 6 illustrates the RST diagnostic payload that is returned by a
   peer that resets a TCP connection for a reason code 1234 defined by a
   vendor with the private enterprise number 32473.

   {
    "reason-code": 1234
    "pen": 32473
   }

       Figure 6: An RST Diagnostic Payload to Report Vendor-Specific
                             Reason Code (JSON)

   Figure 6 uses the Enterprise Number 32473 defined for documentation
   use [RFC5612].

4.  IANA Considerations


4.1.  JSON Mapping Parameters to CBOR

   IANA is requested to create a new subregistry titled "RST Diagnostic
   Payload CBOR Key Values" under the "Transmission Control Protocol
   (TCP) Parameters" registry [IANA-TCP].

   The structure of this subregistry and the initial values are provided
   below:

   | reason-description |   3  | 3 text string | String |[ThisDocument]|
   +====================+======+===============+========+==============+

   The key value MUST be an integer in the RANGE2.

   The assignment policy for this registry is "IETF Review" (Section 4.8
   of [RFC8126]).

4.2.  New Registry for TCP Failure Causes

   This document requests IANA to create a new subregistry entitled "TCP
   Failure Causes" under the "Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
   Parameters" registry [IANA-TCP].

   Values are taken from RANGE.

   The assignment policy for this registry is "Expert Review"
   (Section 4.5 of [RFC8126]).

   The designated experts may approve registration once they checked
   that the new requested code is not covered by an existing code and if
   the provided reasoning to register the new code is acceptable.  A
   registration request may supply a pointer to a specification where
   that code is defined.  However, a registration may be accepted even
   if no permanent and readily available public specification is
   available.

   The registry is initially populated with the following values:

5.  Security Considerations

   [I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis] discusses TCP-related security
   considerations.  RST-specific attacks and their mitigations are
   discussed in Section 3.10.7.3 of [I-D.ietf-tcpm-rfc793bis].

   In addition to these considerations, it is RECOMMENDED to control the
   size of acceptable diagnostic payload and keep it as brief as
   possible.  Also, it is RECOMMENDED to avoid leaking privacy-related
   information as part of the diagnostic payload (e.g., including a
   description such as "user X resets explicitly the connection" is not
   recommended).

6.  Acknowledgements

   The "diagnostic payload" name is inspired by Section 5.5.2 of
   [RFC7252] that was cited by Carsten Bormann in the tcpm mailing list.
